Getting started on Google+
Find people you knowCircles are the heart of Google+ - they control who you  
share with and whose posts you see.  Find people you know, then drag and  
drop them into circles that match your real-world relationships.

See what people are sharingNow that you've added people to your circles,  
visit your stream to see what they're saying. When you find something you  
like, add a comment or click +1 to just say "cool!"

Share somethingTo post for the first time, click "Share what's new" - you  
can include photos, videos, and links. Select the circles or people you  
want to share with, or choose "Public" so that anyone can see what you have  
to say.
